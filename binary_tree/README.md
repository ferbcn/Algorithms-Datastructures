# Example of a BST (binary search tree) implemented in Python3
##Author: Fernando Garcia Winterling (ferbcn)

A BST has an average time complexity of O(n) = n * log(n) for sorting an array.
Useful for efficiently sorting large data sets

Time complexity of BST:
  	                  Access 	Search 	    Insertion 	Deletion
Binary Search Tree 	Θ(log(n)) 	Θ(log(n)) 	Θ(log(n)) 	Θ(log(n))

##Conclusion: Python's built-in sorting method is highly optimized!
